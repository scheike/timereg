* Version 1.3.1 <2015-01-01 Thu>
  - fast.approx updated with 'left'...

* Version 1.0.0 <2014-11-18 Tue>
  - New functions biprobit.time, binomial.twostage.time.
    Automatically samples time points (approximately equidistant) up to
    last double jump time. Intial support for left truncation.
    contrast argument added to biprobit.time.
  - ipw removed (from namespace)
  - biprobit optimized for tabular data (non-continuous
    covariates). Regression design for dependence parameter (tetrachoric
    correlation) now possible.
  - predict method implemented for biprobit
  - arc-sinus transformation used for probability estimates
  - updated output of bptwin with relative recurrence risk + log-OR estimates
  - iid method for bptwin (influence function)
  - survival probabilities and start and end of intervals added to
    lifetable
  - new function 'jumptimes' for extracting jump times and possibly sample (equidistant)
  - fast.pattern updated to handle more than two categories
  - demos added to the mets package
  - divide.conquer function, folds function

* Version 0.2.8 <2014-05-07 Wed>
  - Normal orthant probabilities via 'pmvn' (vectorized)   
  - Parametric proportional hazards models via 'phreg.par'
  - twinlm.time function for censored twin data. Wraps the 'ipw'
    function that now also supports parametric survival models via
    phreg.par. 'grouptable' for tabulating twin-data.
  - Relative recurrence risk ratios now reported with bptwin/twinlm.
  - Grandom.cif more stable
    
* Version 0.2.7 <2014-02-18 Tue>
  - Adapted to changes in 'timereg::comp.risk'
  - cluster.index with 'mat' argument for stacking rows of a matrix
    according to cluster-variable
  - New lava-estimator: 'normal', for ordinal data (cumulative probit)
  - fast.reshape more robust. Now also supports 'varying arguments of
    the type 'varying=-c(...)' choosing everything except '...'.

* Version 0.2.6 <2013-12-07 Sat>
  - C++ source code cleanup
  - Optimization of fast.reshape

* Version 0.2.5 <2013-11-01 Fri>
  - New datasets: dermalridges, dermalridgesMZ
  - Grouped analysis updated in twinlm (e.g. sex limitation model)
  - Confidence limits for genetic and environmental effects are now
    based on standard (symmetric) Wald confidence limits. (use the 'transform'
    argument of the summary method to apply logit-transform)
  - Improved output in twinlm
    
* Version 0.2.4 <2013-07-10 Wed>
  - fast.reshape :labelnum option for both wide and long format (see
    example)
  - Compilation flags removed from Makevars files

* Version 0.2.3 <2013-05-22 Wed>
  - fast.reshape bug-fix (column names)

* Version 0.2.2 <2013-05-21 Tue>
  - Updated twinlm. bptwin: OS analysis 
     - Better starting values for twinlm
  - Fixed claytonaokes.cpp

  - easy.binomial.twostage

* Version 0.1-4 <2012-09-07 Fri>
  - Fixed cor.cpp
  - New datasets: twinstut, twinbmi, prtsim

* Version 0.1-3 <2012-07-05 Thu>
  - twinlm moved to mets package, and wraps the bptwin function

* Version 0.1-2 <2012-05-14 Mon>
  - code clean-up and minor bug-fixes

* Version 0.1-1 <2012-05-06 Sun>

  - Random effects CIF models moved from MultiComp to mets
  - new data sets: np, multcif
  - Documentation via roxygen2
  - bug fixes

* Version 0.1-0 <2012-04-25 Wed>

  - Initialization of the new package 'mets' with implementation of the
    Clayton-Oakes model with piecewise constant marginal hazards, and
    the bivariate probit random effects model (Liability model) for
    twin-data.
